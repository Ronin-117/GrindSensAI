# ## ⚙️ Prerequisites

# Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

# *   [Node.js (LTS version recommended)](https://nodejs.org/)
# *   [Python (3.8+ recommended)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
# *   [Pip (Python package installer)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
# *   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
# *   (Potentially) A C++ compiler and relevant build tools if MediaPipe requires local building for some components.

# ## 🚀 Getting Started

# Follow these steps to get a local copy of GrindSensAI up and running.

# ### 1. Clone the repository

# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/Ronin-117/GrindSensAI.git
# cd GrindSensAI
# ```

# ### 2. Backend Setup (Django)

# Navigate to your backend directory (e.g., `cd backend` - adjust if different):

# ```bash
# # Create and activate a virtual environment
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
#
# # Install Python dependencies
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# # Set up environment variables (if any)
# # cp .env.example .env
# # # Then, update the .env file with your specific configurations (e.g., Gemini API Key, DB_SECRET_KEY)
#
# # Apply database migrations
# python manage.py migrate
#
# # Create a superuser (optional, for admin panel access)
# python manage.py createsuperuser
#
# # Run the backend server
# python manage.py runserver
# ```
# The backend will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

# ### 3. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

# Navigate to your frontend directory (e.g., `cd frontend` or `cd client` - adjust if different):

# ```bash
# # Install Node.js dependencies
# npm install
# # or
# # yarn install
#
# # Set up environment variables (if any, for API endpoints, etc.)
# # cp .env.example .env
# # # Then, update the .env file
#
# # Run the frontend development server
# npm run dev
# # or
# # yarn dev
# ```
# The frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:3000/` (or another port specified by Vite).

# ### 4. (Optional) Automated Startup

# You mentioned an "automated app startup process." If you have a script for this (e.g., using `concurrently` or a shell script), include instructions here:
# *Example:*
# ```bash
# # (In the root directory)
# # This script might start both frontend and backend servers.
# ./start_app.sh
# # or
# # npm run start-all
# ```

# ## 🎮 Usage

# 1.  Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/`).
# 2.  **Sign up** for a new account or **Login** if you already have one.
# 3.  Explore your **Dashboard**: Check your activity, get motivated!
# 4.  Navigate to **Workout Routines**:
#     *   Browse preset routines.
#     *   Use the AI to generate a new routine tailored to you.
#     *   Create or modify routines.
# 5.  Go to **Today's Workout**:
#     *   Select a routine for your session.
#     *   Start an exercise. The **SuperVision** camera feed will activate.
#     *   Follow the on-screen guidance for correct form. Reps will be counted automatically!
# 6.  Check your **Profile** to see your progress and "Heat Level".

# ## 🧪 Running Tests

# Provide instructions on how to run tests for both frontend and backend if you have them.

# *   **Backend (Django):**
#     ```bash
#     # (In the backend directory)
#     python manage.py test
#     ```
# *   **Frontend (React/Vite):**
#     ```bash
#     # (In the frontend directory)
#     npm test
#     # or
#     # yarn test
#     ```
